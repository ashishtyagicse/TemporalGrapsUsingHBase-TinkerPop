# HBaseTinkerPopGraph
Creating temporal graphs using Apache TinkerPop with Apache HBase as backend graph database.

Storing and changing hierarchical data sets can be a challenge, especially if data is in temporal form (Parts of it changing over time). One simple way to effectively store this data can be using graphs. A lot of the time these hierarchical data sets are in a form of a tree which is just a specialized version of graph. Storing data in this form has some inherent advantages such as easy representation /visualization of data, fast and well known traversal algorithms proven across industry, easy manipulation of parts of data without changing or duplicating the entire datasets. 

This project demonstrates how to use an up and coming Graph framework like Apache TinkerPop over big data storage like Apache Hbase to simulate the hierarchical structures. 

See [Documentation](Implementing Temporal Graphs using Apache TinkerPop and HGraphDB.pdf) for more details.
